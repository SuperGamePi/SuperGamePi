# SuperGamePi
The SuperGamePi is a Raspberry Pi based retro emulator that works out of the box! 

The SuperGamePi is an initiative to bring a **retro emulator** to your home!
The system **works out of the box** and requires very little configuration in order to be fully enjoyable.
The heart of the system is based on the **Raspberry Pi 2**, a very powerfull little computer! 

The first case design is made using 123D Design by Autodesk and is printed using a **3D printer**. The design allows access to the HDMI out, Micro USB, audio port, 2 USB's and the LAN port.

The system runs **all the major retro systems** such as the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Gameboy, Sega Megadrive, PC engine/Turbografx and the list goes on and on! These systems can be played using a **wide arrange of controllers** including USB SNES controllers and even your own Xbox 360 or Xbox one controller!

The system can be connected to every **modern monitor** that has an HDMI port, so you can play all your retro favorites on the big screen.

So far the project is going very smooth and the *RetroPie project* software from the Petrockblog is working great!
For visual updates on the project follow the SuperGamePi on the @supergamepi instagram!

I wish you fun playing amazing retro games!

Kind regards,
